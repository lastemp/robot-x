# robot-x

This is a robot-x program developed as a Rust Smart Contract(running on Solana Blockchain - devnet), 
It simplifies actions of a robot on-chain. 
This program acts as an example for developers who are new to Solana ecosystem to learn on how the typescript client interacts with the program on-chain. 

Below are some basic features contained in the program:

- Create
- Walk
- Run
- Jump
- Reset

## Getting started

In order to run this example program you will need to install Rust and
Solana. Information about installing Rust can be found
[here](https://rustup.rs/) and information about installing Solana can
be found [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

Once you've completed the Solana installation run the following
commands to configure you machine for local development:

```
solana config set --url localhost
solana-keygen new
```

These two commands create Solana config files in `~/.config/solana/`
which solana command line tools will read in to determine what cluster
to connect to and what keypair to use.

Having done that run a local Solana validator by running:

```
solana-test-validator
```

This program must be left running in the background.

## Deploying the Solana program

To deploy the Solana program in this repository to the Solana cluster
that you have configured run:

```
anchor deploy
```

## Running the test program

To run the test program you must have already deployed the Solana
program. The test program sends a transaction to the Solana
blockchain asking it to execute the deployed program and reports the
results.

```
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```
